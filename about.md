<p>I'm a researcher and developer at the Music Technology Group from Universitat
Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona. My fields of interest include signal processing
and machine learning for audio, speech and music applications.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm working on an industrial project helping SonoSuite to automatically
assess audio quality and defects on large music collections. Also, I am actively
contributing to the development of Essentia, an open source C++ library for audio
and music analysis, description and synthesis.</p>

<p>On my free time, I'm an amateur guitarist and music producer, interested in metal and electronic music.</p>
